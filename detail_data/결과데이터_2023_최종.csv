Ether draws to a base of warm sandalwood from Ceylon and musk, with sweet hints of vanilla and caramel.

Impressive, ancestral formations rise up like exclamations to the sky. They are known as ?òfairy chimneys?? natural pillars of soft, friable rock shaped by volcanic eruption, the passage of time and the weathering of the elements. They watch over the mountains, craters, plateaus and gorges, over the underground and cave-dwelling cities.
The palette of Cappadocia is organic, carnal: white jasmine, ochre benzoin, Turkish rose, gold vanilla and tawny sandalwood. Come nightfall, a purple iris arrives and then the chimney tops secretly open, releasing the caressing perfume of flowers, resins and woods: a message to the stars. A multi-coloured hot-air balloon appears on the horizon; the passengers in its basket sail above the landscape?ôs varied facets, swept away by its airy, scent-filled beauty.

The story ??which also gives the fragrance its name ??is that of ten women who prudently save oil so they can burn their lamps as they await the bridegroom?ôs arrival. We know that of the ten, only five ??described as very wise - participate in the wedding party; the others, having gone to find more oil for their lamps, find the door closed to them. ?úLord, open to us?? they say upon arriving, receiving the response: ?úTruly I say to you: I do not know you?? We also know that, while they were awaiting the groom?ôs arrival, they too fell asleep, but were ready to wake up and rejoice: ""stay awake, therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour"", we read in Matthew.
This is just the start. The idea is to go beyond the evangelism of these words and face our fears on a deeper, more intense level, evoking conflicting emotions and experiencing the seductive charm of danger ??an ""amor fati"" as Nietzsche claimed ??or at least, the presence of things beyond our control. This is a characteristic feature of horror literature (and more); it?ôs the power of the uncontrolled over us. Yet the existence of fear always requires something else: not lack of courage, but the presence of what we most desire. What remains most men?ôs highest aspiration is also a harbinger of trouble: freedom.
The perfume conveys the idea of destruction, the choice to be silent, and the introspection needed to delve into the depths of the skin?ôs most remote existence.
Yet seeking to control it stirs attraction and even feelings of pleasure towards that sought-after, desired fear.
Man is caught in a horrific fate, and our society, with the violent approval of the mob, tries to daze itself and deny the truth, or rather Being-for-death.
Only in this way does man become I in his darkest, unspoken shadow, displaying his true nature made up of contradictions and desires. Faced with fear, seemingly chaotic primordial needs composed of dormant, hidden, and dangerous eroticism are triggered, making the impossible possible.
The packaging is in line with the UNUM collection; this time it is sealed with a cold transparent film and a silver label. The bottle (also silver) is placed in a ""silent"" black velvet bag, sealed in a heat-shrunk sheath which needs to be cut physically using the metal scissors contained in the box.
Following his religious fall into the realm of dust, faced with life on a fragile planet, and having lost all his bearings, man is inextricably connected to fear, forced to wander in the dark side of the soul. Inside that room, he perceives a dim light that reveals deformed limbs sharing monstrous things that seek to destroy respectability and take pleasure in suffocating souls, no longer reckoning with life?ôs balance sheets but with a form of salvation that?ôs ever more distant.","Lemon, Cardamom, Bergamot, Lily of the Valley, Cedar, Galbanum","Marine notes, Jasmine, Iris, Rose","Musk, Tonka Bean, Sandalwood, Amber",100,35.0877,24.5614,14.0351,10.5263,66.6667,100,85.9649,85.9649,94.7368,73.6842,,

That is why the perfumer, Ibrahim Al Zouabi, used to call it the liquid gold.
On a cold Swedish winter night, while the perfumer was sitting by the fireplace and reading an ancient myth, he decided to design a warm fragrance that reduces stress, calms the heartbeat, restores inner peace, and stimulates the hormones of happiness. At the same time, it's inspired by the scent of princes, kings, and nobles of the Middle Ages.
He planned to build an Oud fragrance, but with a unique and different feeling from all the existing Oud perfumes. The blending of jasmine and saffron with Bulgarian roses and amber, in addition to oud, musk, and vanilla, took the fragrance to a sensual, imaginative, exciting, and attractive space, to be the new imaginary woody perfume from the house of Pana Dora.","Saffron, Thyme, Jasmine, Graperfuit, Geranium","Lavender, Woody Notes, Cardamom, Amber, Rose, Cypress","Agarwood (Oud), Fir Resin, Amber, Cedar, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Musk, Vetiver",100,27.5,10,10,5,100,54.5455,30.303,84.8485,33.3333,81.8182,,

It's an olfactory journey into the heart of nature, embodying the spirit of the outdoors and transporting you straight into the untouched wilderness of the Targhee Forest.
This fragrance opens with a lively and bright top note of Juniper Berry, the tangy zest of Citrus, and the crisp, fresh aroma of Fir Balsam. These notes create an initial burst of freshness, akin to a revitalizing breath of crisp mountain air.
As the scent unfolds, the heart notes of Sagebrush, Pine, and Geranium come forward. The Sagebrush gives a unique herbal and slightly camphoraceous quality, weaving a silver thread through the composition. Pine adds a resinous, woody warmth reminiscent of sun-heated tree bark. The Geranium contributes a green, leafy aroma that evokes an image of dew-kissed foliage.
The base notes include Oakmoss, Cedarwood, Patchouli, Amber, and Musk. The Oakmoss lends an earthy, deeply green nuance, grounding the fragrance and connecting it to the forest floor. Cedarwood adds a robust, woody depth, while Patchouli imparts a rich, slightly sweet and spiced undertone. The Amber brings a warmth and golden glow, while the Musk adds a sensuous, skin-like veil that keeps the fragrance lingering for hours.
Overall, Targhee Forest is a complex and layered fragrance, evocative of a tranquil forest scene bathed in dappled morning sunlight. It's a celebration of the great outdoors, a scent that captures the essence of a serene, untouched wilderness. It offers a soothing, grounding and uplifting experience, making it a perfect choice for those who appreciate nature-inspired fragrances.","Pine, Fir, Oakmoss, Geranium, Cedarwood, Citruses, juniper berry, Patchouli, Musk, Amber",,,100,59.5745,17.0213,12.766,2.12766,62.5,100,65,100,97.5,50,,

When a boat starts to move, in fact, its thrusters have to overcome an immense inertia, generated by the weight and shape of the boat itself, immersed in the water. Let us imagine Telea?ôs unfurled sails swelling to pull the mast fixed to its deck forward, thanks to the sheer power of the wind, but in moments that sometimes seem eternal, nothing happens and the boat remains motionless; then suddenly and with a momentum of its own, not governed by man, the boat generates motion. This thrust is the headway: difficult to get going, but then almost unstoppable. There are two types of headway, increasing and decreasing, both of which are daughters of the same mother and which a good sailor must come to terms with in order to sail safely. The headway is a magic trick of motion that has always fascinated seafarers because of its beauty that is not fully revealed and is ever changing and fickle depending on the weather conditions. Every boat has its own soul and therefore its own headway, which can never be the same as any other. A kind of inimitable, unique fingerprint, just as the creation inspired by it is inimitable and unique. This magical and unpredictable, mysterious and inexplicable force is fully encapsulated in the Starfish Collection bottle. Just like the force of the unstoppable headway that can only be controlled by expert hands, this creation can be discovered by profound connoisseurs of the art of perfumery. Abbrivio opens with a fresh, frothy, fruity bouquet, thanks to the scent of Brazilian Orange with Dolomite Blackcurrant and Romagna Strawberry, emphasised by the aromatic hint of Mediterranean Santolina. The unpredictable and evolving head settles into an even more trembling and untamed heart where, from the outset, the seductive force of Ambergris is felt, combined with the contrast of Coumarin and Adriatic Seaweed, softened by the persuasiveness of Amazonian Tonka Bean and Cuban Cane Sugar. The base of this mysterious creation is firmly rooted in the strong notes of Atlas Cedar and Singapore Patchouli, strengthened by the regal presence of Tuscan Oak and Australian Sandalwood, then emphasised by the persuasive combination of Romagna Oak Moss and Musk. Abbrivio encapsulates the mysterious force of motion generated by obscure forces that reverberate in the lapping water like magical effluvia capable of seducing and bewitching, for those who are not afraid to venture into the coral blue of life.","Brazilian Orange, Santolina, Strawberry, Black Currant","Seaweed, Brown sugar, Tonka Bean, Coumarin, Ambergris","Atlas Cedar, oak moss, Musk, Australian Sandalwood, Oak, Singapore Patchouli",100,58.3333,41.6667,41.6667,0,88.8889,100,88.8889,77.7778,100,100,,

It occurred in 1954 and its overpriced formula did not help its continuation. No matter, the fact remains that this perfume imprinted an unforgettable souvenir in the collective memory...
In 2018 the Panouge group - the owner of the brand, chose to relaunch the Extract as close as possible to its original version. The result was a composition elevated as an object of desire for any passionate of authentic Haute Parfumerie. Wild and Sensitive, the EdP (Eau de Parfum) version challenges the aura of the extract with its sensational solfeggio of the noblest notes and its harmony with a perfect fall.
The Peach mingles with the impressively vivid and playful unchanged floral bouquet filled with Lilac, Rose, Jasmine and Ylang. However, when worn, the EdP version is iridescent and woodier than the extract, thanks to the talent of the perfumer who had the audacity to rewrite the formula, rather than a lower concentration of ingredients.

""As much as for the Extrait we have organized a competition among perfumers., this time Patrice Revillard, who has achieved a beautiful work on the extract, was alone. The challenge was to seduce another audience without disappointing the aficionados of the original""; explains Rania Naim, Artistic Director of Jacques Fath Parfums.
At the heart of all attention, the Iris, with its powdery and woody violet flower facets, is produced with Firmenich's Orriscience technology, allowing to optimize the development process of the Irone (flavor ingredient) in the Rhizomes. This know-how makes it possible to produce by steam distillation an Iris ""butter""; or Iris Concrete at a level of Irone ranging from 8% up to the absolute at level of Irone at 75%. Thus, it gets as close as possible to the Rhizome?ôs representation.

""It seems natural to me to introduce contemporary ingredients into a formula, even for a historical perfume. After all, musicians perform seventeenth- century music scores with today's instruments without distorting the music in the slightest.&quot; explains perfumer Patrice Revillard.

VANILLA FROM TAHITI -  AN EXQUISITE INGREDIENT
Native to Central America, the plant of vanilla belongs to orchid family; it has a typical Liana shape and grows in humid tropical forests.
Vanilla is a spice that is born thanks to a true act of love. The process of pollination of the flower, artificially induced by man, is actually called ?úMarriage??
A wise and delicate work that only expert hands can make and that brings out the fruit of the plant.
Several varieties of vanilla exist, among those, the most vibrant is the VanillaTahitensis. The fruit ripens directly in the plant without man's intervention thus naturally and spontaneously releasing the typical warm, exotic, and sweet notes.
The raw material extraction process is innovative and modern.
The vanilla from Tahiti is not extracted with solvents but through a more natural and less invasive process, known as CO2supercritical, which preserves all the aromatic facets and the identity of its natural profile to ensure an extract of high purity. Itsolfactoryqualities are unique. The captivating aroma of this powerful, inebriating, and exotic raw material brings to life the soft and oily texture of the vanilla pod.
VANILLE DE TAHITI EXTRAIT DE PARFUM
Thisperfumeembodies the search for the sublime balance of raw materials in a crescendo of elegant sensuality where the precious Absolute of Vanilla from Tahiti is perfectly mingled with the exotic floracy of Ylang Ylang Absolute, Champaca Absolute, and a surprising touch of Magnolia Absolute, infusing a bewitchingly fascinating sillage.
The base is a warm embrace revealing the intensity of Amber, Sandalwood, and Musk.

In 1970, a fragrance line called Baby Dior was born: today, it is reborn with a collection full of softness, inspired by the ""Bonne √âtoile"" (Lucky Star).

Bonne √âtoile is the scented water for babies and children from Baby Dior, a poetic co-creation born of the encounter between Francis Kurkdjian, Dior Perfume Creative Director, who composed the fragrance, and Cord√©lia de Castellane, Artistic Director of Baby Dior, who imagined the dreamy decor of the bottles.

This scented water is formulated without alcohol and with 98%* natural-origin ingredients. It is a childhood memory that comes to life in soft notes of pear, wild rose, and white musks.

The pastel-coloured bottle of Bonne √âtoile is adorned with an imaginary and fantastical garden of Granville, featuring a menagerie and colorful hot air balloons, a Toile de Jouy pattern specially created for the occasion.

More than a scented water, it is an object imbued with reverie that can be personalised with the colored ribbon of your choice to accompany your child like their lucky star.""
Pear Note: A juicy, dewy, and green note.
Wild Rose Note: A soft floral note.
White Musk Note: A cottony, velvety note.
""For Baby Dior, I wanted to create a scented water for little ones that is as simple as they are. A child says 'yes,' says 'no,' 'I like' or 'I don't like.' A formula imposed itself, like an impulse, a smile. I wanted to bypass the inevitable orange blossom, which has long been the signature scent of childhood, and find a soothing fragrance in a different formula: a dewy and green pear note, brightened by wild rose, wrapped in soft, cottony, protective musks.??

slow sun fire
where the water rests with me

with the hours marked by a warm wind
shadows of cicadas
silence of the prickly pear
in an orange
that stings the loneliness.
What does it mean today: ""there is no hurry""?
In the obsession of the speed paradoxically the cognition of the time is lost. Here then the desire to stop to recognize and build the solitude of a sunny afternoon.
Slowness then becomes a necessary Caress, almost like boredom, to sink into the limits of silence and continue to listen to life in a way that has now become unknown.
Relying on the arms of a wind without running, which moves the earth burned by memories, is a courage of few, because bathing in this value revolutionizes and repairs.

Candied violet shows up in the most unexpected way, like a daydream of violet flavored candy from a distant memory.
The notes are blended together in such a way that the fragrance feels almost dewy, as though the fresh iris and violets were picked during a rain shower.

Very often, it is a tragic error which, in various cultures and over the centuries, leads back to the deepest sin, but with a heroic twist, because it stems from failing to achieve a goal, in rebellion against one?ôs duty or destiny, sometimes for the sake of a greater good or an irrepressible feeling. It embodies the pride of choice in an extreme struggle between morality and happiness; the emblem of guilt borne with dignity and awareness, because sometimes it is worth living out one?ôs passions without compromise or remorse. This creation embodies this very celestial conflict in its evocative notes, in the thrill of irrepressible passion that echoes in the breast of those who know how to dare beyond good and evil. Hamartia opens with a bouquet that is persuasive and sweet, amiable and generous, where the strength of Italian Black Chocolate marries Peruvian Coffee Beans, counterbalanced by the energy of spices, such as African Cardamom and Indian Coriander, emphasised by bubbly Calabrian Bergamot. The strong, decisive head rests on an equally generous and opulent heart, where the scents of Turkish Caramel mixed with Bourbon Vanilla Beans from Madagascar emerge, accentuated by the bold notes of Singapore Patchouli and the persuasiveness of Tibetan Osmanthus and Tuscan Lily of the Valley. The base of the creation has a strong, reverberating foundation, capable of giving incredible persistence to the entire olfactory structure. Here we immediately feel the gentle presence of Brazilian Tonka Beans and the peaty overtones of Haitian Vetiver, united in a perfect alliance, thanks to the muted aromas of Musk, with the precious woods of Cuban Cedar, Indian Agarwood and Romagna Birch. Hamartia is the creation that best embodies the heroic spirit of passion without limits, of a love that is heated and fiery, sensual and seductive, that generates turmoil in the soul and excitement on the skin. Dedicated to those who are bold enough, without regrets or inhibitions, to embark on an epic journey to the destinations of absolute pleasure.","Chocolate, Coffee, Calabrian bergamot, Cardamom, Spices, Coriander","Singapore Patchouli, Bourbon Vanilla, Caramel, Lily of the Valley, Osmanthus","Tonka, Musk, Precious Woods, Birch, Haitian Vetiver, Agarwood, Cedar",100,28.5714,28.5714,14.2857,14.2857,100,50,16.6667,100,50,66.6667,,

Paysandou and New York each have their own aromatic signatures, shaped and inspired by Gabriela Hirst's two geographical regions and stages of life. They were created to be read individually and as a progression.
""Working with Julian on this project of 2 years has been thrilling. It combines my life so far, half with my roots in Paysand√∫ and half in New York. Childhood memories and landscapes (for Paysand√∫) and the strength of womanhood (for New York) are combined with the alchemy of science and the pheromone potion that Julian crafted. Julian is hungry for knowledge."" - Gabriela Hearst.
""New York draws its inspiration from the movement from South to North, weaving floral and notas dulces with typical North American woods. It?ôs a smokier, heavier, and more aged version of the spirit of the rural and herbal Paysand√∫.
Based on the research of two Nobel prizes, Leopold Ruzicka ??who during the mid-1920?ôs studied the molecular structure of musk??and Linda B. Buck ??awarded in 2004 alongside Richard Axel, for their discoveries in scent as a code and a subtle form of communication through volatile molecules??Julian Bedel developed this idea of musk as a language, an amplifier of one?ôs scent. This compound of pheromone messengers helps volatilize the aroma of skin. As a result, each individual?ôs aromatic identity gets amplified and gives a distinctive character to each perfume. Ultimately, each person will have a different version of the scent. An exclusive formula of Fueguia?ôs musk of plant origin was developed both for Paysand√∫ and New York.
True to Fueguia?ôs mission of botanical research and scientific innovation, the ingredients that compose Paysand√∫ were produced in Fueguia Botany in Manantiales, Uruguay. Marcela and Carqueja, ingredients that had never been used in perfumery, were extracted through Super Critical CO2 at Fueguia?ôs unique high-end facilities and are what gives a significant part of the unique character of the scent. Marcela, traditionally used by the Charr√∫as people as a medicinal plant, is still a symbol of this cultural heritage in Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.""

In some parts of the lake, at the beginning of autumn, the air smells of osmanthus and strawberry grapes. In some points on the lake shore, you can smell the earth and wet woods, the damp leaves and the laurel blend together to form a whole with the other elements. In those moments the feeling is intoxicating.
October Lake is enveloping and intense, just like autumn. As beautiful as this season can be in its wonderful colors which, although a little more melancholy, dress the panorama as only autumn can do. It takes you to the place without being there, on a journey that will accompany you until next spring. And the journey is beautiful.","Cassis, Blackberry, Aquatic notes, Bay Leaf, Isabella Grape, Strawberry, Osmanthus, Bergamot, Orange","Papyrus, Ylang-Ylang, Lavender, Tuberose, Iris, Neroli","Vetiver, Musk, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Vanilla",100,85.7143,57.1429,14.2857,14.2857,57.1429,28.5714,14.2857,100,71.4286,42.8571,,
